# sunshine-sell

Sunshine Stores is an e-commerce project for my portfolio set by Codecademy's Full Stack Development Course. The theme is eco-products.

The front-end is React and the backend is Node js and PostgreSQL. I also used Stripe for the payment process and Passport and Bcrypt for the password storage. 

The front-end is deployed on Netlify and the backend on Heroku. 

You can visit it here - it takes a second or three to spin up! https://sunshine-store.netlify.app/
